    <h1>Homemade Sushi</h1>

    <p>Homemade Sushi Rolls are a versatile recipe that can be filled with any ingredients you choose. The prep time is roughly 40 minutes, with a cook time of 25 minutes. This recipe will yield 4 rolls that can be cut into as many, or as little pieces you would like. We recommend serving with tamari sauce, or dark soy sauce.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cups water</li>
        <li>2/3 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat - <strong><em>This can be substituted with sushi salmon, or teriyaki chicken, for example</em></strong></li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber - peeled, cut into small strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150 degrees C (300 degrees F).</li>
        <li>Cook the short-grain white rice in a rice cooker. Alternatively, cook rice on the stove top until the water has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet, and heat the nori in the preheated oven until warm for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat (alternatively use a clean dish towel). Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the centre. Lift one end of the meat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients. </li>
        <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 6 to 8 slices.</li>
    </ol>
